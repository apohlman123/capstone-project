# capstone-project
Repository for Audio Production Instrument 
Senior Capstone Project 
Austin Pohlman and Clay Sauter
Created 19Nov18

  This repository holds all Python3, PureData (Pd), etc... code developed
  by Clay and Austin during the 2018-2019 school year as part of our Electrical
  Engineering Senior Capstone Project. Its purpose is to provide version control
  and coherently keep track of code developed by Clay and Austin across multiple
  platforms and languages. 
  
  Through the use of Git terminal commands or the Atom-Git interface, local
  repositories may be created and updated to reflect new alterations to our project.
  Additionally, the Raspberry Pi 3B+ operating systems comes with Git pre-installed,
  so any updates to the main repository can be easily accessed by the Rasperry Pi 3B+,
  which is our central processing unit for this project.
  
  The following is a list of relevant Git commands to be used with local and remote repos:
